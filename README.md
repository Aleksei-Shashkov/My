## Projects

### Project 1: Online School Unit Economics Calculator

*What needed to be done:*
- to present the business model of the cinema: who, where and to what extent watches films on this platform;
- calculate the unit economy of the product;
- prepare scenarios for setting up parameters for the business to reach a 25% marginality;
- evaluate the effectiveness of the business model from the point of view of the financial component.

[#My/Project_1](https://github.com/Aleksei-Shashkov/My/tree/main/Project_1)

**Conclusions:** the current business model is inefficient from financial aspect:
- Retention is falling;
- the number of new subscribers is decreasing;
- revenue is falling.

To bring the business out of a crisis situation and achieve profitability of 25%, 2 scenarios are proposed:
- with the prospect of reaching the target level in 12 months;
- with the prospect of reaching the target level in 18 months.

### Project 2: Modeling changes in the balances of students of the SKYENG online school using SQL

*What needed to be done:* simulate the change in student balances:
- determine the number of lessons on the balance of all students for each calendar day;
- reflect the dynamics of changes in lessons under the influence of transactions (payments, accruals) and lessons (deductions from the balance as lessons progress);
- create a table of balances of each student for each day.

[#My/Project_2](https://github.com/Aleksei-Shashkov/My/tree/main/Project_2)

**Conclusions:** 
1. The table of balances of each student for each day has been created.
2. During 2016, there is an increase in 
- the total number of lessons on students' balance sheets;
- transaction numbers;
- the number of lessons written off.
Most likely, this is due to the growing number of students studying on the platform.
3. Anomalies in the data were identified, sent to data engineers / owners of tables for analysis.
